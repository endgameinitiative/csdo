## Timeline

Proposed by Owocki

1. we do our review of each others docs in google docs to make sure we are approaching consensus.  comments + discussion for a week or two. (csdo - mid nov)
2. blow away k2.endgame.gitcoin.co and create an entirely new resource csdo.endgame.gitcoin.co that represents all of our briefs (owocki)
3. fold in a couple things from k2.endgame.gitcoin.co. add TLDRs everywhere for E#Z reading. (owocki)
4. a week or two of review/vibe check from this group (csdo - early dec)
5. identify gaps or anything we want to change before ethdenver (owocki leading)
6. A ill turn this into a nice glossy infographic/presentation that i give at ethdenver (owocki - feb 2024)
6. B have some sort of debate on gov forums/proposal to ratify endgame with stewards/steward council (owocki -async w 6a)

## Feedback by others;

Meg: i'm noodling on this! it seems like a good plan to complete roadmaps for each of our specific areas, but i'm wondering if the exercise as a whole would be more effective if we tackled how the various workstreams collaborate to drive network effects? I've recently had some good conversations with the Allo team and Program team about aligning on shared objectives, and I'd love to use the endgame as a vehicle for that alignment if others think this would be valuable. Wdyt?

Laura: I 100% agree. I think we can specifically focus on creating more clarity on how our products serve each other to create network effects (as the EIs state). Something I'm very bullish on is coordinating around a strategy that unites us under the Gitcoin banner.

While this would take more coordination, I think it will pay off in the short to mid term
